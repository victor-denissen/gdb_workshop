Compile the program with the -g flag
	cc -g {files}

gdb {Program_name}
	Run gdb

lay src
	go to the source layout

break/b {func_name}
break/b {file_name}:{line_number}
	Create a breakpoint on a certain func or line in a file
	Breakpoints tell the debugger when to stop running the code and to go into step by step mode

run/r {cmd_arg1} {cmd_arg2} {cmd_arg...}
	Now we need to start running the program, you can do this with the run command
	If you want program arguments you can give them here


kill
	To stop the currently running program

quit
	To quit gdb

if you want to rerun the program from the start you can just do the run/r command again

# TIP, if you want to re-enter the same command, you can just press enter without typing anything
